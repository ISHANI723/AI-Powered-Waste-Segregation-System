# AI-Powered-Waste-Segregation-System
Manual waste sorting is inefficient leading to landfill overflow and low recycling rates. An AI powered waste segregation system can help in waste identification promoting sustainable waste management practices. 

# Objectives
1. Develop an AI model capable of accurately classifying waste into dry, wet and paper categories.
2. Automate the waste sorting process to reduce the need for manual intervention and minimize human error.
3. Improve recycling rates by ensuring accurate segregation of recyclable materials.
4. Minimize landfill waste through effective waste categorization and redirection of recyclables.
5. Lower operational costs by reducing the need for manual labor and improving process efficiency.
